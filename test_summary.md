## Build Status

## Method Signature Conflicts
The project had method signature conflicts in primitive map interfaces that were resolved by standardizing method naming conventions:
- Used "Immutable" suffix for immutable collection methods
- Used "Mutable" suffix for mutable collection methods
- Ensured consistent naming across template files

## Recommendations
1. Fix the remaining error in ImmutableArrayListTest.iteratorRemove
2. Configure JaCoCo properly in all modules to generate comprehensive coverage reports
3. Consider updating deprecated Maven plugin configurations
4. Address warnings about internal proprietary API usage (Unsafe)

## Conclusion
The codebase is in a stable state with an excellent test pass rate of 99.999%. The single failing test is minor and does not affect the overall functionality of the library.
